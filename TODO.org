* TODO [1/3] User configuration file
** DONE Define configuration file location
** TODO Load configuration file
** TODO Define configuration options
This will somewhat mirror what we have in [[*Command-line options][Command-line options]]

* TODO [3/5] Interact with database
** DONE Define database location
** DONE Add file info to database
** DONE Remove file from database
** TODO Add file to store location and add file info
** TODO Figure out why I need to put with-db everywhere
I thought that I could use ~with-db~ to wrap entire function bodies, with control-flow and multiple calls to ~query*~ in it.
The macro probably needs some kind of work done on it to accept bodies correctly.

* TODO [0/4] Store files
** TODO Define store location
This should probably be done with the configuration file

** TODO Index files already in location for validation
** TODO Add file to store
** TODO Register file with database

* TODO [0/2] Command-line options
** TODO Look into (guile) getopt-long
** TODO Define command line options
*** Configuration file location
*** No config file
*** Start server (for Emacs interaction)
Look at how mu4e does this with the ~mu server~ command.

* TODO [0/3] Others
** TODO Look at (guix colors) for how ANSI color output is defined.
** TODO Have ~query*~ throw an error if used outside of with-db context
** TODO Do PROPER error handling of the SQLite statements!
