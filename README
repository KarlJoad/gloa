Gloa is an academic article management program written in Guile Scheme.
It is intended to closely inter-operate with GNU Emacs.

* Requirements
   * GNU Guile >= 3.0

* Building
#+begin_src sh
$ ./bootstrap && ./configure && make
#+end_src

* Running with Installing
This works by adding ~gloa/scripts~ to the front of ~$PATH~, so we find the ~gloa~ script first.
#+begin_src sh
$ ./pre-inst-env gloa --help
#+end_src

* Development
** Updating ~pre-inst-env~
To update the pre-install environment script, you must re-~configure~ the package.
#+begin_src sh
$ ./configure
#+end_src

* License
GNU GPLv3 or later.  See =COPYING= for the full license text.
